# Pintu Mobile Engineer Technical Test - Part 2 (Website using React JS)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Assumptions

- Yearly change in [Price API](https://api.pintu.co.id/v2/trade/price-changes) was set to null, so I removed the yearly column on the website.
- For React JS app, I'm using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux.js.org/introduction/why-rtk-is-redux-today) to show a simpler way to use Redux without boilerplate-y code as said in the documentation.
- For [React Native app (Android)](https://github.com/JuliusHmto/pintu-native-app) I'm using regular Redux with actionCreators and actionTypes. 

## How to Run

- ### `npm install`
- ### `npm start`
